FPGA INTEGRATION CHECKLIST - PERSON A
================================================================================

STATUS: ⏸️ WAITING FOR PERSON C

PREREQUISITES (Person C must provide):
---------------------------------------
[ ] New system.xsa file with FPGA accelerators integrated
[ ] Memory map document with addresses:
    [ ] DMA controller base address
    [ ] FPGA accelerator base address
    [ ] DDR input buffer address
    [ ] DDR output buffer address
    [ ] Control/status register offsets
[ ] DMA configuration guide
[ ] Accelerator control sequence documentation
[ ] Expected data formats and alignment requirements

INTEGRATION STEPS (Do after receiving above):
----------------------------------------------
[ ] Step 1: Import new system.xsa
    - Create new platform project from Person C's XSA
    - Rebuild BSP
    - Verify new peripherals appear in Address Editor

[ ] Step 2: Update fpga_controller.cpp with real addresses
    - Replace PLACEHOLDER defines with actual addresses
    - Fill in DMA initialization code
    - Implement start/stop accelerator functions

[ ] Step 3: Add DMA driver
    - Include xaxidma.h
    - Add DMA initialization
    - Implement transfer functions

[ ] Step 4: Build and test hardware connection
    - Build project
    - Program FPGA
    - Verify DMA transfers work (loopback test)

[ ] Step 5: Run first FPGA inference
    - Load one test image
    - Execute FPGA path
    - Check if output is received (even if wrong)

[ ] Step 6: Debug and validate
    - Compare FPGA output vs CPU output
    - Debug any mismatches with Person B
    - Iterate until prediction matches

[ ] Step 7: Performance measurement
    - Run 10+ inferences
    - Calculate average time
    - Compute speedup vs CPU baseline

[ ] Step 8: Final validation
    - Test with multiple images
    - Document all results
    - Create comparison table

CURRENT BLOCKERS:
-----------------
❌ Waiting for Person C to deliver hardware package
❌ Cannot proceed with DMA implementation
❌ Cannot test FPGA path

READY COMPONENTS:
-----------------
✅ CPU baseline frozen (30.26 ms)
✅ Validation functions written
✅ Comparison framework ready
✅ Timing measurement code ready
✅ Test harness prepared

ESTIMATED TIME AFTER PERSON C DELIVERS:
----------------------------------------
- Integration: 2-3 hours
- First working test: 1-2 hours
- Debugging: 2-4 hours (depends on issues)
- Performance testing: 1 hour
Total: 6-10 hours

CONTACT:
--------
Person A: Integration and validation owner
Person B: Consult if FPGA output doesn't match CPU
Person C: Hardware platform provider (BLOCKING)
